            <h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
            <p>
                Having recovered from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans 
                decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with approximately 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They 
                massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal used the double 
                envelopment tactic and surrounded his enemy, trapping the majority of the Roman army, who were 
                then slaughtered. The loss of life on the Roman side was one of the most lethal single day's 
                fighting in history; Adrian Goldsworthy equates the death toll at Cannae to "the massed 
                slaughter of the British Army on the first day of the Somme offensive in 1916."[1] Only about 
                15,000 Romans, most of whom were from the garrisons of the camps and had not taken part in the 
                battle, escaped death. Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states 
                defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.
            </p>
            <h1>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
            <p>
                Never when the city was in safety was there so great a panic and confusion within the walls of 
                Rome. I shall therefore shrink from the task, and not attempt to relate what in describing I 
                must make less than the reality. The consul and his army having been lost at the Trasimenus the
                 year before.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula 
                were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro) 
                completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there 
                was not a single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. 
                The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people 
                alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea.

            <h1>Ancient Egypt - The Pharoahs</h1>
            <p>
                In Egyptian society, religion was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the pharaoh 
                was as an intermediary between the gods and the people. The pharaoh thus deputised for the 
                gods; his role was both as civil and religious administrator. He owned all of the land in 
                Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief 
                of the army.
            </p>
            <h1>The Tombs of the pharoahs</h1>
            <p>
                The curse of the pharaohs is a curse alleged to be cast upon anyone who disturbs the mummy of 
                an Ancient Egyptian, especially a pharaoh. This curse, which does not differentiate between 
                thieves and archaeologists, is claimed can cause bad luck, illness, or death. Since the 
                mid-20th century, many authors and documentaries have argued that the curse is 'real' in the 
                sense of having scientifically explicable causes such as bacteria or radiation.
            </p>
            <h1>The Pyramids</h1>
            <p>
                The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt. As of 
                November 2008, sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identified Egyptian pyramids.
                Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and 
                Middle Kingdom periods.
